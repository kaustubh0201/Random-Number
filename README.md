## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environment.

### Node

You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

```sh
> sudo apt install nodejs
> sudo apt install npm
```

If the installation is successful, you can run the following command.
```sh
> node --version
v16.20.2

> npm --version
8.19.4
```

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, open the command line again and be happy.
```sh
> npm install npm -g
```

## Installation

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/kaustubh0201/Random-Number.git

## Configure app

Create `.env` then add MongoDB URI in it. You will need to make a cluster on MongoDB Atlas or start the MongoDB server locally.
Also put the JWT_SECRET token in this file.
